    <p>First off, thanks for visiting my site! As you read through this short autobiography, please pay attention because there will be a quiz at the end.</p>

    <h2>A Brief History</h2>

    <ul>
      <li start>
        <p>My name is Trevor Ingram, I live in a tiny town south of Bend, near the Deschutes river. I've lived in Oregon for 28 years, only leaving the state briefly for a short stint in Kansas and Texas. I grew up in the Willamette Valley and shortly after coming back to Oregon, moved to Central Oregon to enjoy it's vast amount of sun! Oregon is by far the most beautiful state I've ever lived in, followed by Texas.</p>

        <p>After graduating Molalla High School, sometime long long ago, I took a break from schooling for a few years before deciding to go to Clackamas Community College. I got my associates degree in auto mechanics and went into the automotive field. I have had many different jobs in the field as I found out that the industry was very cut-throat and had a high turnover rate. After moving to Texas, I landed a job with Hill Country Transit District and started a new chapter of my career in management. Once I moved back to Oregon, I ended up getting a job with Cascades East Transit as the Facility and Fleet Supervisor. After nearly 15 years in the automotive field, life changed, as it tends to do, and I quit my job to pursue a new career path in web development. I now attend Code Fellows while working 4 days a week at Sunriver Resort.</p>

        <p>Now that I've started down a new career path, my mind has gone wild with the possibilities that may await me! I hope to someday get involved with Web3 and the crypto ecosystem. My ideal goal would be to work as a developer for a big name project such as Ripple, Algorand, or Cardano. For now though, I'm learning the basics and growing my skills.</p>
